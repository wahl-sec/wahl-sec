InfoSec and automation enthusiast mostly working with `Python` üêç but I am also interested in `Rust` ü¶Ä

#### `Projects`
Currently I am working on a couple projects when I have time over, these are:

##### `rsd`
A `Rust` package meant to be an all-in-one tool for crafting small data collection scripts for different systems with plugins support.

##### `doc-log`
A `Python` docstring parser and feature extractor with support for passive and active type checking at runtime, docstring logging and more.

##### `trident`
An asynchronous system automation library with plugin support, making it possible to generate pipelines of setup scripts, system monitoring and similar. (`RSD` is mean to be a replacement to this)
